# AI Training Review Interface Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Training Review Interface is a comprehensive Streamlit-based system that allows instructors to efficiently review, correct, and improve AI-generated homework grades. This interface serves as the critical feedback loop for training the AI grading system while providing instructors with powerful tools for managing student assessments at scale.
