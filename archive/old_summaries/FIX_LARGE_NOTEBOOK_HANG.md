# Fix for Large Notebook Hang Issue

## Problem
The grading system was hanging when processing Alejandro De Santiago's notebook:
- File: `desantiagopalomaressalinasalejandro_21935_11607677_Submit 3 - Homework 3 - Alejandro De Santiago Palomares Salinas.ipynb`
- Size: **439.8 KB** (7,448 lines)
- Issue: Output comparison was taking too long or hanging indefinitely

## Root Cause
The `OutputComparator` class was attempting to compare every cell output between the student notebook and solution notebook. For very large notebooks with extensive outputs (like large dataframes), this comparison was:
1. Memory intensive
2. CPU intensive  
3. Taking an extremely long time (possibly infinite loop)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Size-Based Skipping (Primary Fix)
Added a size check that **skips output comparison** for notebooks larger than 200KB:

```python
notebook_size_kb = os.path.getsize(notebook_path) / 1024

if notebook_size_kb > 200:
    print(f"⚠️ Notebook too large ({notebook_size_kb:.1f} KB), skipping output comparison to prevent hang")
    output_comparison = None
```

**Why 200KB?**
- Successful notebook (Deon Schoeman): 84 KB ✅
- Problem notebook (Alejandro): 440 KB ❌
- 200KB threshold safely separates normal from problematic notebooks

### 2. Timeout Protection (Secondary Fix)
Added a 30-second timeout for output comparison using signal alarms:

```python
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
signal.alarm(30)  # 30 second timeout
try:
    comparator = OutputComparator(notebook_path, solution_notebook_path)
    output_comparison = comparator.compare_outputs()
finally:
    signal.alarm(0)  # Cancel the alarm
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added size reporting at multiple stages:
- Initial notebook size check with KB and MB display
- Warnings for notebooks > 300KB
- Critical warnings for notebooks > 10MB

## Testing

Run `test_large_notebook.py` to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_large_notebook.py
```

Expected output:
```
Problem notebook: 439.8 KB (0.43 MB)
✅ This notebook WILL skip output comparison (> 200KB threshold)

Success notebook: 84.0 KB (0.08 MB)
✅ This notebook will run output comparison normally
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Large notebooks would hang indefinitely
- Batch grading would stop at problematic notebooks
- Manual intervention required

### After Fix
- Large notebooks skip output comparison automatically
- Grading continues without hanging
- Still validates code, just skips output comparison
- Timeout protection as backup safety measure

## Files Modified

1. `business_analytics_grader.py`:
   - Added size checks before validation
   - Added size checks before output comparison
   - Added timeout protection for output comparison
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

## Next Steps

If you encounter more hanging issues:

1. Check the console output for notebook size warnings
2. Adjust the 200KB threshold if needed (in `business_analytics_grader.py`)
3. Adjust the 30-second timeout if needed
4. Consider adding size limits to the upload interface

## Notes

- Output comparison is helpful but not critical for grading
- The AI grader can still evaluate code quality without output comparison
- This fix prioritizes reliability over completeness
- Large notebooks often indicate students included too much output (which should be cleaned before submission)
