# Assignment 3 Grading Fixes

## Problem Identified:
AI was hallucinating missing sections and being too harsh on students who completed all work.

**Example:** Logan Balfour
- **Reality:** All 21 code sections complete with outputs, short reflections
- **AI Said:** "18 out of 20 sections (90%)", "missing geographic analysis", "missing customer frequency"
- **AI Should Say:** "21 out of 21 sections (100%)", reflections need more depth

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Updated AI Prompts (av3_code_analysis_prompt.txt)
**Added verification rules:**
- "If you see OUTPUT below the code, the section IS COMPLETE"
- "Do NOT mark as incomplete if output is visible"
- "Do NOT say 'you did not complete' if code AND output are present"
- Added specific examples for sections 19-21 that were being hallucinated as incomplete

### 2. Adjusted Rubric (assignment_3_rubric.json)
**Rebalanced weights to prioritize code over reflections:**

**Old weights:**
- Technical Execution: 25% (9.375 pts)
- Data Analysis: 30% (11.25 pts)
- Business Thinking: 25% (9.375 pts)
- Communication: 20% (7.5 pts)

**New weights:**
- Technical Execution: 20% (7.5 pts) ⬇️
- Data Analysis: 40% (15.0 pts) ⬆️ **MOST IMPORTANT**
- Business Thinking: 20% (7.5 pts) ⬇️
- Communication: 20% (7.5 pts)

**Rationale:** This is a coding assignment. If all code works with outputs, student should get 80%+ even with short reflections.

### 3. Added Better Verification Logic
**New validation rules:**
- Output verification: "If code has visible output, section is COMPLETE"
- Examples added: "Code: head(data, 5) + Output showing 5 rows = COMPLETE"
- Double-check step: "Review your incomplete list - if output is visible, remove from incomplete!"

## Expected Score Changes:

### Logan Balfour Type Submissions:
**Profile:** All code complete with outputs, short reflections (50-75 words each)

**Old Score:** 28-30 points (75-80%)
**New Score:** 30-33 points (80-88%)

**Breakdown:**
- Data Analysis: 15/15 (100% - all code works!)
- Technical: 7/7.5 (93% - good code quality)
- Business: 5/7.5 (67% - reflections short but present)
- Communication: 5/7.5 (67% - clear but brief)

### Excellent Work:
**Profile:** All code complete, detailed reflections (100+ words each)

**Old Score:** 34-37.5 points (90-100%)
**New Score:** 34-37.5 points (90-100%) - unchanged

### Template Only:
**Profile:** Minimal code, no outputs

**Old Score:** 7.5 points (20%)
**New Score:** 7.5 points (20%) - unchanged

## Key Principle:
**"If the code works and produces correct outputs, the student has demonstrated competency in data transformation, regardless of reflection depth."**

Short reflections should reduce score from A to B+, not from A to C.

## Testing:
Re-grade Logan Balfour's submission to verify:
- Should recognize all 21 sections as complete
- Should not hallucinate missing sections
- Should score 30-33 points (80-88%)
- Should note reflections need more depth but acknowledge all code is correct
