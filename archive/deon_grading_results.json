The use of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` is appropriate for the task, and the visualizations effectively communicate the key findings. The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The summary statistics provide a good overview of the data. The identification of a slight positive correlation between age and grade is a reasonable observation based on the data.",

The reflection questions highlight this learning, specifically mentioning the importance of data quality and the use of `case_when()` for creating categorical variables. The student's willingness to acknowledge the limitations of their approach (e.g., removing missing data) demonstrates a growth mindset and a commitment to continuous learning."

Specifically, looking into mean/median imputation or more advanced techniques like k-nearest neighbors imputation. Further statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests or correlation tests with p-values), would strengthen the conclusions. The student could also explore more complex visualizations, such as boxplots or scatter plots with regression lines, to gain deeper insights into the data.",

        "Continue to practice data cleaning and manipulation techniques using `dplyr`. Explore more advanced data visualization techniques using `ggplot2`. Focus on learning statistical hypothesis testing to validate findings and draw more robust conclusions. Actively seek out opportunities to apply these skills to real-world datasets and business problems. Continue to prioritize reflective practice \u2013 regularly asking yourself what you learned, what challenges you faced, and how you can improve your analytical skills."

The analysis is well-executed, the code is clear and concise, and the reflections demonstrate a strong understanding of the analytical process and a commitment to continuous learning. The student's ability to critically evaluate their own work and identify areas for improvement is particularly commendable. Keep up the great work!"
