The current code uses absolute file paths which won't work on other computers:

```r
# Current (problematic):
sales_df <- read_csv("/workspaces/assignment-1-logan3941/data/sales_data.csv")

# Better approach:
sales_df <- read_csv("data/sales_data.csv")
# or
sales_df <- read_csv("../data/sales_data.csv")
```

**Make sure:** Your working directory is set correctly using getwd() and setwd() if needed. Use relative paths that work from your project root directory.

üîß **Enhanced Data Inspection**

Add more comprehensive data quality checks:

```r
# Check for missing values by column
colSums(is.na(sales_df))

# Check for duplicates
sum(duplicated(sales_df))

# Look for outliers in numeric columns
boxplot(sales_df$Amount, main="Amount Distribution")

# Check unique values in categorical columns
table(sales_df$Region)
table(sales_df$Product)
```

üîß **Improved Documentation**

Add comments to explain your analytical thinking:

```r
# Load required packages for data analysis
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Import sales transaction data
sales_df <- read_csv("data/sales_data.csv")

# Perform initial data exploration to understand structure
head(sales_df, 10)  # View first 10 rows to see data format
str(sales_df)       # Check data types and structure
summary(sales_df)   # Get statistical summary of numeric variables

    overall_assessment = """Logan demonstrates solid foundational skills in R programming and data management. The technical execution is clean and functional, showing good understanding of basic data import and exploration techniques. However, the assignment reveals opportunities for growth in analytical depth and written communication.

**Strengths:**
‚Ä¢ Clean, executable code that accomplishes all technical requirements
‚Ä¢ Proper use of tidyverse and readxl packages
‚Ä¢ Systematic approach to data exploration using appropriate R functions
‚Ä¢ Accurate identification of basic data characteristics

**Areas for Development:**
‚Ä¢ Written analysis lacks depth and business context
‚Ä¢ Reflection responses are too brief for university-level work
‚Ä¢ Missing discussion of data quality implications for business decisions
‚Ä¢ Code portability could be improved with relative file paths

**Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Practice writing more detailed analytical observations (aim for 2-3 sentences per insight)
‚Ä¢ Connect technical findings to business implications
‚Ä¢ Develop habits around code documentation and portability
‚Ä¢ Explore additional data quality assessment techniques

Logan shows strong potential and with more attention to analytical depth and communication, will excel in future assignments."""
