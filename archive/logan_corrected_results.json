      "\u25a0 Working Directory (2.0/2.0 points) \u2705 Excellent: Logan properly checked the working directory and understood the file structure. The code execution shows good awareness of the workspace setup.",

      "\u25a0 CSV Import (6.0/6.0 points) \u2705 Excellent: Successfully imported sales data using read_csv() with proper file paths. The absolute paths work correctly in the given environment and demonstrate understanding of file system navigation.",
      "\u25a0 Excel Import (6.0/6.0 points) \u2705 Excellent: Correctly imported both sheets from the Excel file using appropriate sheet parameters. Demonstrates solid understanding of multi-sheet Excel handling with readxl package.",
      "\u25a0 Data Inspection (6.0/8.0 points) \u26a0\ufe0f Satisfactory: Used head(), str(), and summary() functions appropriately. However, the analysis of results is quite basic. Logan correctly identifies data types and dimensions but misses opportunities for deeper insights about data quality, business implications, and analytical readiness.",
      "\u25a0 Reflection Questions (8.0/12.5 points) \u274c Needs Work: Logan's written responses are very brief and lack the depth expected for university-level work. For example, responses like 'there are 3 number variables, 2 character variables, and a date variable' are factually correct but too simplistic. What I'm looking for: Detailed discussion of specific data quality issues, their potential business impact, how they might affect analysis, and thoughtful consideration of data preprocessing needs. Each reflection should be 2-3 sentences minimum with specific examples and business context."
