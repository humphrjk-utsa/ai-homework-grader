What I'm looking for: Detailed discussion of specific data quality issues, their potential business impact, how they might affect analysis, and thoughtful consideration of data preprocessing needs. Each reflection should be 2-3 sentences minimum with specific examples and business context."

Add more comprehensive data quality checks to your analysis:

```r
# Check for missing values by column
colSums(is.na(sales_df))
colSums(is.na(ratings_df))
colSums(is.na(comments_df))

# Check for duplicates
sum(duplicated(sales_df))

# Look for outliers in numeric columns
boxplot(sales_df$Amount, main="Sales Amount Distribution")
summary(sales_df$Amount)

# Check unique values in categorical columns
table(sales_df$Region)
table(sales_df$Product)

# Check data ranges and consistency
range(sales_df$Date)
range(ratings_df$ProductRating)
```

üîß **Improved Data Exploration**

Expand your analysis to uncover business insights:

```r
# Calculate key business metrics
sales_by_region <- sales_df %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(
    total_sales = sum(Amount),
    avg_transaction = mean(Amount),
    transaction_count = n()
  )

# Examine rating distributions
ratings_summary <- ratings_df %>%
  summarise(
    avg_product_rating = mean(ProductRating),
    avg_service_rating = mean(ServiceRating),
    avg_satisfaction = mean(OverallSatisfaction)
  )

print(sales_by_region)
print(ratings_summary)
```

üîß **Better Documentation and Comments**

Add analytical context to your code:

```r
# Load required packages for data analysis
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(readxl)     # For reading Excel files

# Import sales transaction data for business analysis
sales_df <- read_csv("/workspaces/assignment-1-logan3941/data/sales_data.csv")
print("Sales data imported successfully!")

# Perform initial data exploration to understand business context
head(sales_df, 10)  # View sample transactions
str(sales_df)       # Understand data structure for analysis planning
summary(sales_df)   # Get statistical overview of business metrics

    # Updated overall assessment
    overall_assessment = """Logan demonstrates solid foundational skills in R programming and data management. The technical execution is clean and functional, showing good understanding of data import and exploration techniques. The code runs successfully and accomplishes all required tasks effectively.

**Strengths:**
‚Ä¢ Clean, executable code that accomplishes all technical requirements
‚Ä¢ Proper use of tidyverse and readxl packages
‚Ä¢ Successful data import from multiple sources (CSV and Excel)
‚Ä¢ Systematic approach to data exploration using appropriate R functions
‚Ä¢ Accurate identification of basic data characteristics

**Areas for Development:**
‚Ä¢ Written analysis lacks depth and business context
‚Ä¢ Reflection responses are too brief for university-level work
‚Ä¢ Missing discussion of data quality implications for business decisions
‚Ä¢ Could benefit from more comprehensive data exploration techniques

**Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Practice writing more detailed analytical observations (aim for 2-3 sentences per insight)
‚Ä¢ Connect technical findings to business implications (e.g., "What do missing values mean for business decisions?")
‚Ä¢ Explore additional data quality assessment techniques
‚Ä¢ Develop habits around comprehensive data exploration

Logan shows strong technical competency and with more attention to analytical depth and communication, will excel in future assignments. The foundation is solid - now focus on building analytical thinking skills."""
