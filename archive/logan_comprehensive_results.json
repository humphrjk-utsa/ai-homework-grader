Logan correctly identifies data types and dimensions but misses opportunities for deeper insights about data quality, business implications, and analytical readiness.",
      "\u25a0 Reflection Questions (8.0/12.5 points) \u274c Needs Work: Logan's written responses are very brief and lack the depth expected for university-level work. For example, the response 'the data seems good, the only one that is hard to use is the feedback text' is too simplistic. What I'm looking for: Detailed discussion of specific data quality issues, their potential business impact, how they might affect analysis, and thoughtful consideration of data preprocessing needs. Each reflection should be 2-3 sentences minimum with specific examples."
