# Template Notebook Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed the template_notebook feature from the system as it was stored but never used in the grading process.

## What Was Removed

### Database Schema
**Before:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE assignments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    total_points INTEGER,
    rubric TEXT,
    template_notebook TEXT,  -- REMOVED
    solution_notebook TEXT,
    created_date TIMESTAMP
)
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE assignments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    total_points INTEGER,
    rubric TEXT,
    solution_notebook TEXT,
    created_date TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Files Modified

1. **`app.py`**
   - Removed `template_notebook` from CREATE TABLE statement

2. **`assignment_editor.py`**
   - Removed template file uploader from UI
   - Removed template_path variable and file saving logic
   - Updated INSERT statement to exclude template_notebook
   - Updated UI text to clarify solution notebook purpose

3. **`assignment_manager.py`**
   - Removed template file uploader from UI
   - Removed template_path variable and file saving logic
   - Updated INSERT statement to exclude template_notebook
   - Updated UI text to clarify solution notebook purpose

4. **`migrations/remove_template_notebook.py`** (NEW)
   - Migration script to safely remove column from existing databases
   - Creates backup before migration
   - Handles SQLite's lack of DROP COLUMN support

## Migration Process

### What the Migration Does:
1. **Creates backup** - `grading_database.db.backup_TIMESTAMP`
2. **Creates new table** - Without template_notebook column
3. **Copies data** - All existing assignments migrated
4. **Drops old table** - Removes original table
5. **Renames new table** - New table becomes "assignments"
6. **Verifies** - Confirms all data migrated successfully

### Migration Results:
```
✅ Backup created: grading_database.db.backup_20251003_105649
✅ Migrated 1 assignments successfully
✅ New columns: ['id', 'name', 'description', 'total_points', 'rubric', 'solution_notebook', 'created_date']
```

## Why Template Was Removed

### Template Notebook Was:
- ❌ Stored in database
- ❌ Uploaded through UI
- ❌ Never retrieved or used
- ❌ Not used in grading process
- ❌ Not provided to students
- ❌ Not compared to student work

### Solution Notebook Is:
- ✅ Stored in database
- ✅ Uploaded through UI
- ✅ Retrieved during grading
- ✅ Used for code comparison
- ✅ Used for output validation
- ✅ Used for alternative approach recognition

## Benefits of Removal

### ✅ **Simplified System**
- One less file to manage per assignment
- Clearer purpose (solution = grading reference)
- Less confusion about which file does what

### ✅ **Cleaner Database**
- Removed unused column
- Smaller database size
- Clearer schema

### ✅ **Better UX**
- UI now clearly states solution notebook purpose
- No confusion about template vs solution
- Focused on what matters for grading

### ✅ **Easier Maintenance**
- Less code to maintain
- Fewer potential bugs
- Clearer data flow

## What Remains

### Solution Notebook
The solution notebook is the **only** notebook needed per assignment:

**Purpose:**
- Reference for correct code approach
- Comparison baseline for student code
- Output validation reference
- Alternative approach recognition

**Usage in Grading:**
1. Loaded from database during grading
2. Code extracted from notebook cells
3. Passed to AI grader
4. AI compares student code to solution
5. AI evaluates outputs and approaches
6. AI provides specific feedback with examples

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback the migration:

```bash
# Stop the application first
# Then restore from backup
cp grading_database.db.backup_20251003_105649 grading_database.db
```

However, you would also need to revert the code changes in:
- app.py
- assignment_editor.py
- assignment_manager.py

## Future Considerations

If you later want to provide starter notebooks to students, you could:

1. **Store in separate location** - Not in assignments table
2. **Download feature** - Let students download starter notebooks
3. **Template library** - Separate system for managing templates
4. **Assignment attachments** - Generic attachment system

But for now, the solution notebook is all that's needed for grading.

## Testing Checklist

After migration, verify:
- ✅ Existing assignments still load
- ✅ Can create new assignments
- ✅ Solution notebook uploads work
- ✅ Grading uses solution notebook correctly
- ✅ No errors in UI
- ✅ Database queries work

## Summary

**Removed:** Template notebook (unused feature)  
**Kept:** Solution notebook (essential for grading)  
**Result:** Simpler, cleaner system focused on what matters  
**Backup:** Available if rollback needed  
**Status:** ✅ Migration completed successfully
