# Feedback System Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Fallback Generic Feedback
- **Problem**: System was using generic fallback feedback when AI output was too short or filtered
- **Solution**: Removed all fallback mechanisms - AI must now generate personalized feedback per student
- **Files Modified**:
  - `report_generator.py`: Removed `_generate_fallback_instructor_comment()` usage
  - `ai_grader.py`: Removed `_get_fallback_for_section()` usage
  - Both now return empty strings or warnings instead of generic text

### 2. Enhanced AI Internal Thinking Removal
- **Problem**: AI models (especially gpt-oss:120b) include internal reasoning/thinking in output
- **Solution**: Expanded pattern matching to catch more internal dialogue
- **New Patterns Removed**:
  - `<think>...</think>`
  - `<reasoning>...</reasoning>`
  - `[thinking]...[/thinking]`
  - `[internal]...[/internal]`
  - Phrases like "We need to", "Let's", "The student", "They have"
  - Score breakdowns like "Overall score:", "Business understanding:"

### 3. Improved Prompt Templates
- **Problem**: Prompts didn't emphasize verbose, personalized feedback
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote prompt templates with strict instructions
- **Files Modified**:
  - `prompt_templates/general_feedback_prompt.txt`
  - `prompt_templates/general_code_analysis_prompt.txt`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" section
  - Emphasized writing TO the student (use "you", "your")
  - Required 2-3 sentences per feedback item
  - Demanded specific references to actual student work
  - Prohibited generic/template feedback
  - Examples now show verbose, personalized feedback

### 4. Model Configuration System
- **New File**: `model_config.py`
- **Purpose**: Easy switching between AI models
- **Default Model**: Changed from `gpt-oss:120b` to `gemma3:27b`
- **Reason**: Gemma follows instructions better and produces cleaner output with less internal thinking

### 5. Model-Specific Settings
- **gemma3:27b** (RECOMMENDED):
  - Temperature: 0.3
  - Max tokens: 3000 (increased for verbose feedback)
  - Best for: Clean, verbose, personalized feedback
  
- **gpt-oss:120b**:
  - Temperature: 0.3
  - Max tokens: 2500
  - Note: Very powerful but may include thinking text
  
- **deepseek-r1:70b**:
  - Temperature: 0.3
  - Max tokens: 2500
  - Note: Excellent reasoning but verbose with thinking process

## How to Use

### Switching Models

Edit `model_config.py`:

```python
# Change this line to switch models
PRIMARY_GRADING_MODEL = "gemma3:27b"  # Recommended

# Or use alternatives:
# PRIMARY_GRADING_MODEL = "gpt-oss:120b"
# PRIMARY_GRADING_MODEL = "deepseek-r1:70b"
```

### Verifying Model is Available

```bash
# Check available Ollama models
ollama list

# Pull gemma if not available
ollama pull gemma3:27b
```

### Testing Feedback Quality

1. Grade a few submissions with the new system
2. Check PDF reports for:
   - Personalized feedback (references actual student work)
   - Verbose feedback (2-3 sentences per item)
   - No generic templates
   - No internal AI thinking/reasoning
   - Direct address to student ("you", "your")

### If Feedback is Still Too Short

1. **Check model**: Ensure gemma3:27b is being used
2. **Increase max_tokens**: Edit `model_config.py` and increase `max_tokens` to 4000
3. **Check prompt**: Verify prompt templates emphasize verbose feedback
4. **Try different model**: Some models are naturally more verbose than others

## Expected Feedback Format

### Before (Generic Fallback):
```
"Your work demonstrates engagement with the assignment requirements. 
You've shown good analytical thinking and have made meaningful connections 
to business applications."
```

### After (Personalized, Verbose):
```
"Your implementation of the IQR method for outlier detection was executed 
correctly and produced accurate results. You successfully calculated Q1, Q3, 
and the appropriate thresholds, which demonstrates solid understanding of 
statistical outlier detection. The way you applied this to the sales_data 
dataset shows good analytical thinking. Your reflection on the business 
implications of removing vs. capping outliers was particularly insightful, 
showing you understand how data cleaning decisions affect downstream analysis. 
For future work, consider exploring additional outlier detection methods like 
z-scores to compare different approaches."
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Feedback still contains "We need to", "Let's", etc.
**Solution**: The model is including internal thinking. Switch to gemma3:27b which follows instructions better.

### Issue: Feedback is too short
**Solution**: 
1. Increase `max_tokens` in `model_config.py`
2. Verify prompt templates emphasize verbose feedback
3. Try gemma3:27b which tends to be more verbose

### Issue: Feedback is generic/not personalized
**Solution**: 
1. Check that prompt templates include student code/markdown
2. Verify AI model is receiving actual student work
3. Try regenerating with gemma3:27b

### Issue: Reports show "Feedback not available"
**Solution**: This means AI didn't generate enough feedback. Check:
1. Model is running and accessible
2. Prompt is being sent correctly
3. AI response is being parsed correctly
4. Try increasing timeout for large models

## Performance Notes

- **gemma3:27b**: Faster than gpt-oss:120b, cleaner output
- **gpt-oss:120b**: More powerful but slower, may need more filtering
- **deepseek-r1:70b**: Excellent quality but very verbose with reasoning

## Next Steps

1. Test with gemma3:27b on several submissions
2. Verify feedback quality meets requirements
3. Adjust max_tokens if needed
4. Consider creating model-specific prompt templates if needed
