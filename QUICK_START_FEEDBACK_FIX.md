# Quick Start: Improved Feedback System

## What Changed

✅ **Removed all generic fallback feedback** - AI must now generate personalized feedback per student
✅ **Enhanced AI thinking/reasoning removal** - Better filtering of internal AI dialogue  
✅ **Improved prompts** - Now demand verbose, personalized, student-specific feedback
✅ **Switched default model** - Changed from `gpt-oss:120b` to `gemma3:27b` for cleaner output
✅ **Increased token limits** - More space for verbose feedback (3000 tokens)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Ensure Gemma is Available

```bash
# Check if gemma3:27b is installed
ollama list

# If not, pull it
ollama pull gemma3:27b
```

### 2. Verify Configuration

The system now defaults to `gemma3:27b`. To change models, edit `model_config.py`:

```python
PRIMARY_GRADING_MODEL = "gemma3:27b"  # Current default (recommended)
```

### 3. Test the System

1. Grade a few submissions
2. Generate PDF reports
3. Check that feedback is:
   - **Personalized** (mentions specific student work)
   - **Verbose** (2-3 sentences per item)
   - **Clean** (no "We need to", "Let's", "The student" phrases)
   - **Direct** (uses "you", "your" to address student)

## What You Should See

### ❌ OLD (Generic Fallback):
```
"Your work demonstrates engagement with the assignment requirements."
```

### ✅ NEW (Personalized & Verbose):
```
"Your implementation of the IQR method for outlier detection was executed 
correctly and produced accurate results. You successfully calculated Q1, Q3, 
and the appropriate thresholds, which demonstrates solid understanding of 
statistical outlier detection. The way you applied this to the sales_data 
dataset shows good analytical thinking."
```

## If Feedback is Still Not Verbose Enough

### Option 1: Increase Token Limit
Edit `model_config.py`:
```python
"gemma3:27b": {
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "max_tokens": 4000,  # Increase from 3000
    "description": "Clean, verbose, personalized feedback"
}
```

### Option 2: Try Different Model
Some models are naturally more verbose. Try:
- `deepseek-r1:70b` - Very verbose (but includes reasoning)
- `llama4:latest` - Good balance

### Option 3: Verify Prompts
Check that `prompt_templates/general_feedback_prompt.txt` includes:
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be VERBOSE and SPECIFIC - reference actual student work
- Each feedback item should be 2-3 sentences minimum
- NO generic or template feedback - must be personalized per student
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Feedback not available" in reports
**Cause**: AI didn't generate enough feedback or it was filtered out
**Fix**: 
1. Check model is running: `ollama list`
2. Increase max_tokens in `model_config.py`
3. Verify gemma3:27b is being used

### Still seeing "We need to", "Let's", etc.
**Cause**: Model is including internal thinking
**Fix**: 
1. Ensure using gemma3:27b (better at following instructions)
2. Check prompt templates have "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" section
3. Try regenerating the feedback

### Feedback is generic/not personalized
**Cause**: AI not receiving student work or not following instructions
**Fix**:
1. Verify student code/markdown is in the prompt
2. Check prompt emphasizes "reference actual student work"
3. Try gemma3:27b which follows instructions better

## Model Comparison

| Model | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|-------|------|------|----------------|
| **gemma3:27b** | Clean output, follows instructions, fast | Slightly less powerful | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** |
| gpt-oss:120b | Very powerful, detailed | Includes thinking text, slower | Use if need max power |
| deepseek-r1:70b | Excellent reasoning | Very verbose with thinking | Use for complex analysis |
| qwen3-coder:30b | Great for code | Less good for written feedback | Use for code-heavy work |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test with a few submissions
2. ✅ Verify feedback quality
3. ✅ Adjust settings if needed
4. ✅ Grade full assignment batch
