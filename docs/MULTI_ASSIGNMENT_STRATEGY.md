# Multi-Assignment Training Strategy
## Handling 18 Assignments (9 R + 9 SQL)

### Recommended Approach: Language-Specific Models

For your course with 18 diverse assignments, here's the optimal training strategy:

## Phase 1: Setup and Initial Grading (Weeks 1-3)

### Assignment Naming Convention
Use clear naming to help the system identify language types:
- **R assignments**: "R Assignment 1 - Data Import", "R Lab 2 - Visualization", etc.
- **SQL assignments**: "SQL Assignment 1 - Basic Queries", "SQL Lab 2 - Joins", etc.

### Initial Data Collection
1. **Grade first 2-3 assignments normally** (1 R, 1 SQL)
2. **Let AI provide initial grades** - don't worry about accuracy yet
3. **Focus on building training data** - every grade creates training samples

## Phase 2: Language-Specific Training (Weeks 4-6)

### R Model Training
After grading 3-4 R assignments:
1. Navigate to **AI Training → Retrain Model**
2. Select **"Language-Specific Model"** → **"R"**
3. Review and correct 15-20 R submissions
4. Retrain the R-specific model

### SQL Model Training  
After grading 3-4 SQL assignments:
1. Select **"Language-Specific Model"** → **"SQL"**
2. Review and correct 15-20 SQL submissions
3. Retrain the SQL-specific model

## Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

### Weekly Training Routine
**After each assignment batch:**
1. **Quick review** - check 5-10 AI grades for obvious errors
2. **Correct outliers** - focus on scores that seem way off
3. **Retrain monthly** - update models with new corrections

### Assignment-Specific Fine-tuning
For specialized assignments (advanced topics):
1. **Create assignment-specific models** for unique content
2. **Example**: "Advanced SQL - Window Functions" might need its own model
3. **Use when**: Assignment has very different grading criteria

## Training Strategy by Assignment Type

### R Assignments Training Focus

**Code Quality Patterns:**
- Proper use of tidyverse vs base R
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Statistical analysis techniques
- Code organization and comments

**Common R Grading Criteria:**
```
- Data import/export (10-15 points)
- Data manipulation (20-25 points)  
- Visualization (15-20 points)
- Statistical analysis (20-25 points)
- Code quality/comments (10-15 points)
- Interpretation/reflection (10-15 points)
```

**R-Specific Corrections to Focus On:**
- Penalize missing `library()` calls
- Reward proper use of pipe operators `%>%`
- Check for appropriate plot types and labels
- Ensure statistical interpretations are correct

### SQL Assignments Training Focus

**Query Quality Patterns:**
- Proper JOIN usage and syntax
- Efficient query structure
- Correct use of aggregate functions
- Subquery vs JOIN decisions

**Common SQL Grading Criteria:**
```
- Query syntax correctness (20-25 points)
- Proper JOIN usage (20-25 points)
- Aggregate functions (15-20 points)
- Query efficiency (10-15 points)
- Results accuracy (20-25 points)
- Documentation/comments (5-10 points)
```

**SQL-Specific Corrections to Focus On:**
- Reward efficient query design
- Penalize unnecessary complexity
- Check for proper table aliasing
- Ensure result sets are correct

## Advanced Training Techniques

### Cross-Assignment Learning
**Shared Skills Training:**
- Data analysis concepts (both R and SQL)
- Problem-solving approach
- Code documentation standards
- Reflection quality

**Create "Meta-Model":**
- Train on general programming concepts
- Apply to both R and SQL assignments
- Focus on analytical thinking patterns

### Difficulty Progression Training
**Early Assignments (Weeks 1-6):**
- More lenient scoring for syntax errors
- Focus on effort and understanding
- Encourage experimentation

**Mid-Course (Weeks 7-12):**
- Stricter syntax requirements
- Emphasize best practices
- Reward efficiency and elegance

**Advanced Assignments (Weeks 13-18):**
- Professional-level expectations
- Complex problem-solving skills
- Integration of multiple concepts

## Practical Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Set up assignment naming conventions
- Grade first assignments manually
- Let system collect initial training data

### Week 3-4: First Training Cycle
- Review 20+ submissions across R and SQL
- Make corrections focusing on major scoring errors
- Train initial language-specific models

### Week 5-8: Refinement
- Monitor AI performance on new assignments
- Focus corrections on feedback quality and tone
- Retrain models with accumulated corrections

### Week 9-12: Optimization
- Fine-tune models for advanced topics
- Create assignment-specific models if needed
- Focus on consistency across similar assignments

### Week 13-18: Maintenance
- Minimal corrections needed
- Focus on new/unique assignment types
- Monitor for concept drift in later assignments

## Expected Results by Timeline

### After 4 weeks of training:
- **R Model**: 80-85% accuracy on basic assignments
- **SQL Model**: 75-80% accuracy on query-based assignments
- **Time Savings**: 30-40% reduction in grading time

### After 8 weeks of training:
- **R Model**: 85-90% accuracy across all R topics
- **SQL Model**: 85-90% accuracy on complex queries
- **Time Savings**: 50-60% reduction in grading time

### After 12+ weeks of training:
- **Both Models**: 90%+ accuracy on familiar assignment types
- **Feedback Quality**: Matches your teaching style closely
- **Time Savings**: 70%+ reduction in manual grading

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "R model too harsh on syntax errors"
- **Solution**: Make corrections showing more leniency for minor syntax issues
- **Focus**: Reward working code even if not perfect style

### "SQL model doesn't understand query efficiency"
- **Solution**: Add corrections emphasizing performance considerations
- **Focus**: Train on when to reward elegant vs complex solutions

### "Models inconsistent between similar assignments"
- **Solution**: Review correction patterns for consistency
- **Focus**: Document your grading criteria clearly

### "Need assignment-specific model for unique topics"
- **When**: Assignment covers completely new concepts
- **How**: Train separate model with 10+ corrections for that assignment type

This strategy will give you highly accurate, personalized grading for all 18 assignments while minimizing your manual correction workload!
