# AI Training Interface - Fixed

## ✅ Problem Solved

The AI Training page was showing "No submissions found matching your criteria" because it was looking for data in the old `ai_training_data` table, but the Business Analytics Grader stores data in the `submissions` table.

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Data Source
**File:** `training_interface.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `get_submissions_for_review()` to query `submissions` table instead of `ai_training_data`
- Updated `show_training_stats()` to count from `submissions` table
- Fixed `save_correction()` to update `submissions` table

### 2. Enhanced Feedback Display
**Added comprehensive feedback parsing:**
- Detects new Business Analytics Grader format
- Shows instructor comments (truncated for review interface)
- Displays key sections: reflection assessment, analytical strengths, areas for development
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy formats

### 3. Fixed Scoring Scale
**Updated score inputs:**
- Changed from 0-100 scale to 0-37.5 scale
- Updated labels to show "out of 37.5"
- Maintains proper score validation

### 4. Improved Data Integration
**Enhanced correction saving:**
- Updates `submissions` table (primary data store)
- Also adds to `ai_training_data` for historical tracking
- Updates `final_score` when corrections are made

## 📊 Current Status

```
