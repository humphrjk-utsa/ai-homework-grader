2. Select your assignment
3. Click "Train AI Model"
4. The AI will learn from your grading patterns

## üìÅ File Organization Tips

### Student Submission Naming

- Individual files: `studentID.ipynb` (e.g., `john_doe_123.ipynb`)
- ZIP files: Contains notebooks named with student IDs

### Assignment Templates

- Include clear instructions and point values
- Use markdown cells for explanations
- Leave empty code cells for student work
- Include reflection questions

### Solution Notebooks

- Complete all exercises with expected outputs
- Add detailed comments explaining the approach
- Include multiple solution methods where applicable

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Better AI Grading

1. **Consistent Rubrics**: Use the same criteria across assignments
2. **Clear Instructions**: Specific requirements help AI understand expectations
3. **Manual Training**: Grade 10-15 submissions manually before relying on AI
4. **Regular Retraining**: Update AI models as you grade more submissions

### For Efficient Workflow

1. **Batch Processing**: Upload all submissions at once using ZIP files
2. **Review AI Suggestions**: Don't blindly accept AI grades - always review
3. **Detailed Feedback**: Rich feedback improves student learning and AI training
4. **Export Regularly**: Download results as CSV for backup and LMS integration

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Notebook won't execute**: Check for missing libraries or infinite loops
- **AI scores seem off**: Need more training data or inconsistent manual grading
- **Upload fails**: Verify file format (.ipynb) and naming conventions

### Getting Help

- Check the full README.md for detailed documentation
- Review error messages in the Streamlit interface
- Examine the database using any SQLite browser for debugging
