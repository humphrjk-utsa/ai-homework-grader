   - Ensure all quotes are properly closed
   - Verify comma placement

2. **"Rubric validation errors"**
   - Ensure required sections exist: `assignment_info`, `rubric_elements`
   - Check that `max_points` are numeric
   - Verify total points match sum of elements

3. **"No rubric suggestion"**
