    "For the Sales_df sheet it is mostly fine, data is filled in accurately, the content seems sound. Ratings_DF is purely catogrized ratings from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 which makes it easy for analysis, however these ratings are sorted by customer id which requires more context especially when it comes to product rating, meaning that the use of the sales and ratings sheets to do analysis. Finally the comments_df, this sheet is problematic with multiple fields of missing data, data only in plain text. It's use is limited by the stakeholder's value of text-based scrutiny of their products over the ratings sheet."

The most processing needs to happen for the comments_df dataset to be useful to the end user. It would require signifcant data cleanup (such as the creation of a phone column and an email column, and the removal of entries that fail to provide either), this set is most useful for a company who wants to do targeted analysis or a product study with a group of customers."
