    "# Homework 4: Data Transformation with dplyr - Part 2 (Mutate, Summarize, Group_by, Count)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Homework 4! This assignment builds on your foundational dplyr skills by introducing advanced data transformation techniques essential for business analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this homework, you will:\n",
    "- **Master mutate()**: Create new variables and calculated fields for business insights\n",
    "- **Apply summarize()**: Generate aggregate statistics and key performance indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "- **Utilize group_by()**: Perform grouped analysis across business dimensions\n",
    "- **Implement count()**: Conduct frequency analysis and cross-tabulations\n",
    "- **Develop business intelligence**: Combine functions to create comprehensive analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with real company sales data to perform the type of analysis that drives business decisions. This includes:\n",
    "- **Financial Analysis**: Calculate profit margins, ROI, and efficiency metrics\n",
    "- **Performance Segmentation**: Categorize transactions and customers by performance\n",
    "- **Regional Analysis**: Compare performance across geographic regions\n",
    "- **Product Analysis**: Evaluate product category performance\n",
    "- **Time-based Analysis**: Identify trends and seasonal patterns\n",
    "- **Sales Rep Performance**: Assess individual representative effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with `company_sales_data.csv` which contains:\n",
    "- **Sales transactions** with revenue, cost, and unit data\n",
    "- **Geographic information** with regional breakdowns\n",
    "- **Product categories** for portfolio analysis\n",
    "- **Sales representative** performance data\n",
    "- **Date information** for trend analysis\n",
    "- **Customer metrics** for segmentation analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each section by writing R code in the designated areas. Focus on creating clean, well-commented code that demonstrates your understanding of both the technical concepts and business applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: In real business analytics, you're not just manipulating data - you're uncovering insights that drive strategic decisions!"

    "## Part 1: Setup and Data Import\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Load the necessary packages and import your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context**: Every analysis begins with proper data setup. In professional environments, data scientists spend significant time ensuring data is properly loaded and validated before analysis begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you need to do**:\n",
    "1. Load the `tidyverse` package (which includes dplyr)\n",
    "2. Import the `company_sales_data.csv` file \n",
    "3. Examine the structure and basic properties of your data\n",
    "4. Perform initial data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Use `read_csv()` for better data type detection, and always examine your data structure with `str()`, `summary()`, and `head()` functions."

    "**Business Context**: Data quality is paramount in business analytics. Before presenting results to stakeholders, analysts must verify that calculations are correct and identify any data anomalies that could affect decision-making. In professional settings, data validation is often the difference between accurate insights and costly business mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Validation is Critical:**\n",
    "- **Stakeholder Trust**: Executives need confidence in your analysis\n",
    "- **Decision Impact**: Business decisions based on incorrect data can be costly\n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many industries require data accuracy documentation\n",
    "- **Professional Credibility**: Accurate analysis establishes your reputation as a reliable analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **Calculation Verification**: Mathematical accuracy of derived metrics\n",
    "2. **Range Validation**: Ensure values fall within business-logical ranges\n",
    "3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual values that might indicate data issues\n",
    "4. **Consistency Checks**: Verify that related metrics align logically\n",
    "5. **Missing Value Analysis**: Check for gaps in critical business data\n",
    "6. **Business Logic Testing**: Ensure results make practical business sense\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional Validation Techniques:**\n",
    "- Use `all.equal()` for precise mathematical verification\n",
    "- Apply `summary()` to identify outliers and impossible values\n",
    "- Implement logical tests for business rule compliance\n",
    "- Cross-check totals and subtotals for internal consistency\n",
    "- Validate categorical assignments against their criteria\n",

    "**Task**: Answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the business applications of data transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context**: Reflection is a critical part of the learning process in data analytics. Understanding not just how to perform analyses, but when and why to use different techniques, distinguishes proficient analysts from experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to address**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technical Mastery**: Which dplyr function (mutate, summarize, group_by, count) did you find most powerful for business analysis, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Business Impact**: What was the most surprising or valuable insight you discovered in your analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategic Thinking**: If you were presenting these findings to a company executive, which 3 insights would you prioritize and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methodology**: How did grouping and segmentation help reveal patterns that weren't visible in the raw data?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Future Applications**: What additional business questions could you answer with this dataset using the techniques you've learned?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**: Write thoughtful, paragraph-length responses that demonstrate both technical understanding and business acumen."

    "\n",
    "**1. Most Powerful Function for Business Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write your response here - discuss which function you found most valuable and explain why with specific examples from your analysis]\n",
    "mutate(). I could see that being used very often since most datasets need to be tweaked before they can be worked with. It allows you to change and add new things \n",
    "without actually altering the original dataset. I think that would come in handy when the data needs to be manipulated in different ways for multiple reasons. We used mutate() to calculate profit and profit margin\n",
    "mutate(\n",
    "    Profit = Revenue - Cost,\n",
    "    Profit_Margin = (Profit / Revenue) * 100) \n",
    "mutate() is helpful for making these simple calculations like profit that involve multiple columns. I imagine that some data sets an analyst needs to use aren't ready to use with all calculations present, maybe revenue and costs are recorded but profit is not calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Most Valuable Business Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write your response here - identify the insight that would be most actionable for business decision-making]\n",
    "I found it interesting that there is more transactions in the medium category than high.\n",
    "The product category with the best margins could offer insights that influence a great amount of decisions. What to continue selling, similar and complementary products to make, what to discontinue, what audience to target, focus of advertising resources, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Top 3 Insights for Executive Presentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write your response here - prioritize insights based on revenue impact, strategic importance, and actionability]\n",
    "\n",
    "Top Region\n",
    "If efforts were currently focused on an unprofitable region, it could potentially mean that the business has to shift its focus and resources significantly. Focusing more on the top profitable region could mean potential for more revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product category\n",
    "Knowing which product is the most profitable could drive a large amount of decisions, potentially lowering costs if the business was stocking up, hiring employees on a product category that was the least profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profit\n",
    "Businesses need to be profitable, making money to be able to function. Knowing something like profit or forecasted profit could give many the information they need to make and approve important decisions and projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Value of Grouping and Segmentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write your response here - explain how grouped analysis revealed patterns and trends not visible in aggregate data]\n",
    "When we did # Multi-dimensional analysis: Region and Product Category, the results became organized by region, then product category which was easier to understand. The calculations became meaningful, organized and allowed for patterns to be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Future Business Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write your response here - identify additional analyses that could be performed with this dataset and these techniques]\n",
    "To increase amount of profitable deals being made, it would help to know more information about the most profitable deals and high value customers like the average quantity purchased and in each category. This would allow a business to make decisions on how much product to order and where to send their resources. An example of insight that could be gained from this is that maybe software is something that is only purchased one of. It could be a waste of resources to encourage repeat buying on something that can only be purchased one of If software is purchased in bulk then sales could be encouraged by offering deals on bulk orders. Analyses could be done that show the relationship between highly profitable deals, profit, quantity ordered, and product category with percentages included to make it easier to read\n",
