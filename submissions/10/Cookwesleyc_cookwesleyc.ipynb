    "# Homework 4: Data Transformation with dplyr - Part 2 (Mutate, Summarize, Group_by, Count)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Homework 4! This assignment builds on your foundational dplyr skills by introducing advanced data transformation techniques essential for business analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this homework, you will:\n",
    "- **Master mutate()**: Create new variables and calculated fields for business insights\n",
    "- **Apply summarize()**: Generate aggregate statistics and key performance indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "- **Utilize group_by()**: Perform grouped analysis across business dimensions\n",
    "- **Implement count()**: Conduct frequency analysis and cross-tabulations\n",
    "- **Develop business intelligence**: Combine functions to create comprehensive analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with real company sales data to perform the type of analysis that drives business decisions. This includes:\n",
    "- **Financial Analysis**: Calculate profit margins, ROI, and efficiency metrics\n",
    "- **Performance Segmentation**: Categorize transactions and customers by performance\n",
    "- **Regional Analysis**: Compare performance across geographic regions\n",
    "- **Product Analysis**: Evaluate product category performance\n",
    "- **Time-based Analysis**: Identify trends and seasonal patterns\n",
    "- **Sales Rep Performance**: Assess individual representative effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with `company_sales_data.csv` which contains:\n",
    "- **Sales transactions** with revenue, cost, and unit data\n",
    "- **Geographic information** with regional breakdowns\n",
    "- **Product categories** for portfolio analysis\n",
    "- **Sales representative** performance data\n",
    "- **Date information** for trend analysis\n",
    "- **Customer metrics** for segmentation analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each section by writing R code in the designated areas. Focus on creating clean, well-commented code that demonstrates your understanding of both the technical concepts and business applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: In real business analytics, you're not just manipulating data - you're uncovering insights that drive strategic decisions!"

    "## Part 1: Setup and Data Import\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Load the necessary packages and import your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context**: Every analysis begins with proper data setup. In professional environments, data scientists spend significant time ensuring data is properly loaded and validated before analysis begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you need to do**:\n",
    "1. Load the `tidyverse` package (which includes dplyr)\n",
    "2. Import the `company_sales_data.csv` file \n",
    "3. Examine the structure and basic properties of your data\n",
    "4. Perform initial data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Use `read_csv()` for better data type detection, and always examine your data structure with `str()`, `summary()`, and `head()` functions."

    "**Business Context**: Data quality is paramount in business analytics. Before presenting results to stakeholders, analysts must verify that calculations are correct and identify any data anomalies that could affect decision-making. In professional settings, data validation is often the difference between accurate insights and costly business mistakes.\n",

    "- **Stakeholder Trust**: Executives need confidence in your analysis\n",
    "- **Decision Impact**: Business decisions based on incorrect data can be costly\n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many industries require data accuracy documentation\n",

    "**Validation Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **Calculation Verification**: Mathematical accuracy of derived metrics\n",
    "2. **Range Validation**: Ensure values fall within business-logical ranges\n",
    "3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual values that might indicate data issues\n",
    "4. **Consistency Checks**: Verify that related metrics align logically\n",
    "5. **Missing Value Analysis**: Check for gaps in critical business data\n",
    "6. **Business Logic Testing**: Ensure results make practical business sense\n",

    "**Professional Validation Techniques:**\n",
    "- Use `all.equal()` for precise mathematical verification\n",
    "- Apply `summary()` to identify outliers and impossible values\n",
    "- Implement logical tests for business rule compliance\n",
    "- Cross-check totals and subtotals for internal consistency\n",
