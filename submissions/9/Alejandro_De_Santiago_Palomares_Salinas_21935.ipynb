However, I find it interesting to compare the ratings and comments since the ratings give us a quantitative measure of customer satisfaction, while the comments provide qualitative insights into their experiences and opinions. This combination can help identify specific areas for improvement and understand customer sentiment better. This leads to what was mentioned in the ratings section, where we can see that the mean rating for service recommendation is 4.2, which indicates that overall, customers are not satisfied with the service product, which suggest that there could be improvements done to enhance customer satisfaction, and by comparing these to the comments, we can see what exactly needs to be improved."

However, as I mentioned previously, the summary and structure commands do not really serve a purpose for the comments data set since we are analyzing text, so we cannot get mean and median values from text. We could try finding different ways of quantifying these comments and getting better insights from that since mean for text is pointless."

The comments data set is not as complete since it only gives us qualitative data, which is harder to analyze and get insights from. By combining the comments with the ratings, we can get a better understanding of customer satisfaction and what needs to be improved. However, it would be useful to perform different text analysis techniques to quantify the comments and get better insights from them."
