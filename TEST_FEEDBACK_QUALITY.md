# Testing Feedback Quality

## Quick Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to verify feedback meets requirements:

### ‚úÖ Personalization Check
- [ ] Feedback mentions specific student code (function names, variable names)
- [ ] Feedback references actual student reflections/answers
- [ ] Feedback is unique per student (not copy-paste)
- [ ] No generic phrases like "demonstrates engagement"

### ‚úÖ Verbosity Check
- [ ] Each feedback item is 2-3 sentences minimum
- [ ] Instructor comments are 4-6 sentences minimum
- [ ] Feedback explains WHY, not just WHAT
- [ ] Includes specific examples and suggestions

### ‚úÖ Cleanliness Check
- [ ] No "We need to", "Let's", "First," phrases
- [ ] No "The student", "They have" phrases
- [ ] No internal thinking like "<think>", "[reasoning]"
- [ ] No score breakdowns like "Overall score: 85"

### ‚úÖ Direct Address Check
- [ ] Uses "you", "your" to address student
- [ ] Written as if speaking TO the student
- [ ] Conversational but professional tone
- [ ] Encouraging and constructive

## Sample Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Instructor Comments

**‚ùå BAD (Generic Fallback):**
```
Your work demonstrates engagement with the assignment requirements. 
You've shown good analytical thinking and have made meaningful 
connections to business applications.
```

**‚úÖ GOOD (Personalized & Verbose):**
```
Your work on this assignment demonstrates strong engagement and solid 
analytical skills. You successfully completed the IQR outlier detection 
analysis and showed particularly good understanding of statistical 
thresholds. Your reflection responses reveal thoughtful consideration 
of data quality issues, especially your discussion of how missing values 
affect business decisions. The way you approached the comparison of 
different cleaning strategies shows developing expertise in data 
preparation. Your explanation of why you chose median imputation over 
removal was especially commendable and indicates strong potential in 
business analytics. For future work, focus on exploring additional 
outlier detection methods to further enhance your analytical toolkit.
```

### Test Case 2: Reflection Assessment

**‚ùå BAD (Generic):**
```
Shows engagement with reflection questions and demonstrates 
developing analytical thinking.
```

**‚úÖ GOOD (Specific & Verbose):**
```
Your response to the missing value strategy question demonstrates 
thoughtful consideration of business implications. You effectively 
explained why median imputation preserves data distribution better 
than mean imputation, and connected it to maintaining accurate sales 
forecasts. This shows strong critical thinking about how technical 
decisions affect business outcomes. Your discussion of the trade-offs 
between removing incomplete rows versus imputing values was particularly 
insightful, showing you understand that data cleaning isn't just 
technical‚Äîit's a business decision with real consequences.
```

### Test Case 3: Code Strengths

**‚ùå BAD (Generic):**
```
Successfully implements required functions producing correct results.
```

**‚úÖ GOOD (Specific & Verbose):**
```
Your implementation of the IQR method using Q1 <- quantile(sales_data$amount, 0.25) 
and Q3 <- quantile(sales_data$amount, 0.75) was executed correctly and produced 
accurate outlier thresholds. You successfully calculated the IQR as Q3 - Q1 and 
applied the 1.5 * IQR rule to identify outliers, which demonstrates solid 
understanding of statistical outlier detection. The way you used filter() to 
create both the outlier-removed and outlier-capped datasets shows good command 
of dplyr functions. Your code structure is clear and produces the expected 
outputs, making your analysis reproducible.
```

## How to Test

### 1. Grade a Test Submission

```bash
# Start the application
streamlit run app.py

# Grade 1-2 test submissions
# Generate PDF reports
```

### 2. Review PDF Reports

Open generated PDFs and check:

1. **Instructor Assessment Section**
   - Should be 4-6 sentences
   - Should mention specific student work
   - Should use "you", "your"
   - Should be encouraging and constructive

2. **Reflection Questions Feedback**
   - Each question should have 2-3 sentences
   - Should reference actual student answers
   - Should explain what was good and what could improve

3. **Code Strengths**
   - Should mention specific functions/variables
   - Should explain WHY the code is good
   - Should be 2-3 sentences per item

4. **Areas for Development**
   - Should be specific and actionable
   - Should suggest concrete improvements
   - Should be constructive, not critical

### 3. Check for Red Flags

**üö® If you see these, feedback needs improvement:**

- "Feedback not available" messages
- Generic phrases like "demonstrates engagement"
- Internal AI thinking like "We need to evaluate..."
- Very short feedback (1 sentence or less)
- Same feedback across multiple students
- No specific references to student work

### 4. Verify Model is Working

```bash
# Check which model is running
ollama ps

# Should show gemma3:27b (or your configured model)
```

## Debugging Poor Feedback

### Issue: Feedback too short

**Check:**
```python
# In model_config.py
"gemma3:27b": {
    "max_tokens": 3000,  # Should be at least 3000
}
```

**Fix:** Increase to 4000 or 5000

### Issue: Generic feedback

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify prompt templates have CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
cat prompt_templates/general_feedback_prompt.txt | grep "CRITICAL"
```

**Fix:** Ensure prompts emphasize personalization

### Issue: Internal thinking visible

**Check:** Which model is being used?
```python
# In model_config.py
PRIMARY_GRADING_MODEL = "gemma3:27b"  # Should be gemma
```

**Fix:** Switch to gemma3:27b which follows instructions better

### Issue: "Feedback not available"

**Check:** AI response length
```python
# In ai_grader.py, add logging:
logger.info(f"AI response length: {len(ai_response)}")
```

**Fix:** 
- Increase max_tokens
- Check model is responding
- Verify prompt is being sent

## Success Criteria

Your feedback system is working well when:

‚úÖ Every student gets unique, personalized feedback
‚úÖ Feedback is verbose (2-3+ sentences per item)
‚úÖ No generic fallback text appears
‚úÖ No internal AI thinking is visible
‚úÖ Feedback directly addresses the student
‚úÖ Specific student work is referenced
‚úÖ Feedback is constructive and encouraging

## Performance Benchmarks

**Good Feedback Metrics:**
- Instructor comments: 400-800 characters
- Reflection feedback: 200-400 characters per question
- Code strengths: 150-300 characters per item
- Total feedback per student: 2000-4000 characters

**Time Benchmarks (gemma3:27b):**
- First request (loading): 45-60 seconds
- Subsequent requests: 15-30 seconds
- Full assignment (20 students): 10-15 minutes

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run through checklist with test submissions
2. ‚úÖ Verify all quality criteria are met
3. ‚úÖ Adjust settings if needed
4. ‚úÖ Grade full assignment batch
5. ‚úÖ Spot-check a few reports for quality
