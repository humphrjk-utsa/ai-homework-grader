---FOR CODE ANALYSIS PROMPT---

ASSIGNMENT 2V1 SPECIFIC RULES:

HOW TO VERIFY COMPLETION - Check student code for these SPECIFIC elements:

1. DATA IMPORT (Required):
   ✓ Must have: read_csv("messy_sales_data.csv")
   ✓ Must create: messy_sales variable
   ✓ Must show: print() or head() output

2. INITIAL ASSESSMENT (Required):
   ✓ Must have: head(messy_sales) or similar
   ✓ Must have: str(messy_sales) or glimpse()
   ✓ Must have: summary(messy_sales)
   ✓ Must show: actual output from these commands

3. MISSING VALUE IDENTIFICATION (Required):
   ✓ Must calculate: sum(is.na(messy_sales))
   ✓ Must calculate: colSums(is.na(messy_sales))
   ✓ Must show: numeric results (not just code)

4. MISSING VALUE TREATMENT (Required - ONE option):
   Option A: ✓ Must create: sales_removed_na with complete.cases()
   Option B: ✓ Must create: sales_imputed_na with mean/median imputation
   SCORING: If EITHER option completed = FULL CREDIT

5. COMPARE STRATEGIES (Required):
   ✓ Must compare: nrow() of original vs cleaned datasets
   ✓ Must show: actual row counts in output

6. OUTLIER DETECTION IQR (Required):
   ✓ Must calculate: Q1, Q3, IQR for numeric columns
   ✓ Must calculate: lower_bound and upper_bound
   ✓ Must identify: which values are outliers

7. OUTLIER BOXPLOT (Required):
   ✓ Must create: boxplot or ggplot boxplot
   ✓ Must show: visual output (not just code)

8. OUTLIER TREATMENT (Required - ONE option):
   Option A: ✓ Must create: sales_removed_outliers by filtering
   Option B: ✓ Must create: sales_capped_outliers with min/max capping
   SCORING: If EITHER option completed = FULL CREDIT

9. FINAL DATASET SELECTION (Required):
   ✓ Must create: final_sales variable
   ✓ Must assign: one of the cleaned datasets to it

10. COMPARISON SUMMARY (Required):
    ✓ Must compare: dimensions of all datasets (original, removed, imputed/capped, final)
    ✓ Must show: actual numbers in output

11. REFLECTION Q1 (Required):
    ✓ Must answer: "When would you prefer removing rows vs imputation?"
    ✓ Must provide: substantive answer (not just "it depends")

12. REFLECTION Q2 (Required):
    ✓ Must answer: "What do outliers represent? Should they be removed?"
    ✓ Must provide: substantive answer with reasoning

CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
- Each section = 1 point (12 total)
- For optional sections (4 and 8): completing ONE option = full point
- Missing code = 0 points for that section
- Code without output = 0 points (notebook must be executed)
- Template code unchanged = 0 points
- FINAL SCORE: (completed sections / 12) × 100

COMMON MISTAKES TO CATCH:
❌ Student only has template comments, no actual code
❌ Student has code but no output (didn't run notebook)
❌ Student copied code but didn't change variable names
❌ Student skipped reflection questions
❌ Student did neither Option A nor Option B

---FOR FEEDBACK PROMPT---

ASSIGNMENT 2V1 SPECIFIC RULES:

REFLECTION QUESTIONS EVALUATION:

Question 1: "When would you prefer removing rows with missing values vs imputation?"
✓ EXCELLENT (90-100%): Discusses dataset size, missing data percentage, data type, analysis goals
✓ GOOD (75-89%): Mentions 2-3 factors with some reasoning
✓ ADEQUATE (60-74%): Mentions 1-2 factors but limited reasoning
✓ POOR (40-59%): Generic answer like "it depends" without specifics
✓ FAIL (0-39%): No answer or completely off-topic

Question 2: "What do outliers represent in business data? Should they always be removed?"
✓ EXCELLENT (90-100%): Discusses legitimate vs errors, business context, investigation needed
✓ GOOD (75-89%): Mentions multiple perspectives with reasoning
✓ ADEQUATE (60-74%): Basic understanding but limited depth
✓ POOR (40-59%): Oversimplified (e.g., "always remove" or "never remove")
✓ FAIL (0-39%): No answer or completely off-topic

METHODOLOGY EVALUATION:

Missing Value Treatment:
- Option A (removal) = valid if dataset is large enough
- Option B (imputation) = valid if justified with appropriate method
- BOTH options = extra credit for thoroughness
- NEITHER option = major deduction

Outlier Treatment:
- Option A (removal) = valid if outliers are errors
- Option B (capping) = valid if outliers are legitimate extreme values
- BOTH options = extra credit for thoroughness
- NEITHER option = major deduction

CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
✓ All code cells executed with visible output = full credit
✓ Code present but not executed = 50% deduction
✓ Only template code, no student additions = 80% deduction
✓ Incorrect variable names or broken code = deduction per error

REFLECTION QUALITY SCORING:
- Both questions answered excellently = 90-100%
- Both questions answered well = 75-89%
- Both questions answered adequately = 60-74%
- One question missing or poor = 40-59%
- Both questions missing or poor = 0-39%
