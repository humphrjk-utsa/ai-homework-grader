# Quick Reference - Grading System Fixes

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Notebook execution validation** - Detects unexecuted notebooks (50% penalty)
✅ **TODO detection** - Finds incomplete code sections (5% each)
✅ **Reflection validation** - Catches unanswered questions (5% each)
✅ **Honest AI prompts** - No more "start with high scores" instructions
✅ **Removed score inflation** - No artificial minimum scores
✅ **Accurate defaults** - Changed from 90-96 to 50 when AI fails
✅ **Validation in reports** - Issues shown prominently in PDFs

## Validation Penalties

| Issue | Penalty | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Notebook not executed | 50% | No cell outputs |
| Incomplete TODO | 5% each | `# YOUR CODE HERE` remains |
| Unanswered reflection | 5% each | `[YOUR ANSWER HERE]` remains |
| Execution error | 3% each | Cell has error output |
| Empty code cell | 2% each | Blank code cells |

**Maximum total penalty: 90%**

## Scoring Guidelines (New)

| Score | Grade | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 90-100 | A | Exceptional - all requirements completed, working code |
| 80-89 | B | Good - most requirements completed, minor issues |
| 70-79 | C | Satisfactory - basic requirements met, some gaps |
| 60-69 | D | Needs improvement - incomplete, significant gaps |
| Below 60 | F | Insufficient - major portions incomplete |

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test validation on a notebook
python notebook_validation.py path/to/notebook.ipynb

# Run validation test suite
python test_validation.py

# Grade through web interface (includes validation)
streamlit run connect_web_interface.py
```

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `notebook_validation.py` - Validation system
- `test_validation.py` - Test script
- `GRADING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Detailed docs
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Change summary
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `business_analytics_grader.py` - Core grading logic
- `connect_web_interface.py` - Web interface integration
- `report_generator.py` - PDF report generation

## Key Code Changes

### Validation Check
```python
# In business_analytics_grader.py
validation_results = self.validator.validate_notebook(notebook_path)
validation_penalty = validation_results['total_penalty_percent']
```

### Penalty Application
```python
# Apply validation penalty to final score
if validation_penalty > 0:
    penalty_points = (validation_penalty / 100) * final_score_37_5
    final_score_37_5 = final_score_37_5 - penalty_points
```

### Honest Prompts
```python
# Old: "start with high scores (90+)"
# New: "BE ACCURATE AND FAIR" with detailed guidelines
```

## Expected Results

### Template Submission (Problem Case)
- **Before:** 78.7% (29.5/37.5)
- **After:** 13-21% (5-8/37.5)

### Complete Submission
- **Before:** 88-99% (33-37/37.5)
- **After:** 85-99% (32-37/37.5)

### Partial Submission
- **Before:** 67-80% (25-30/37.5)
- **After:** 40-67% (15-25/37.5)

## Validation Output Example

```
⚠️ SUBMISSION ISSUES DETECTED

Critical Issues:
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Notebook was not executed - no cell outputs found
- ⚠️ Found 8 incomplete TODO sections with placeholder code
- ⚠️ Found 2 unanswered reflection questions

Total Penalty: 70% deduction

How to Fix: Notebook Not Executed
1. Open your notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
2. Click 'Run All' or 'Restart Kernel and Run All'
3. Verify all cells show output
4. Save and resubmit
```

## Important Notes

- ✅ System still accepts alternative valid approaches
- ✅ Warnings (package loading) are ignored, not penalized
- ✅ Focus is on completion and execution, not style
- ✅ Validation feedback is clear and actionable
- ✅ Penalties are fair and proportional

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Student got low score but claims they completed work**
A: Check validation section in report - likely didn't execute notebook or left TODOs

**Q: Validation seems too harsh**
A: Adjust penalty percentages in `notebook_validation.py` lines 60-70

**Q: AI still giving high scores for incomplete work**
A: Check that prompts in `business_analytics_grader.py` have the updated guidelines

**Q: Validation not running**
A: Ensure `notebook_path` is passed to `grade_submission()` in web interface
