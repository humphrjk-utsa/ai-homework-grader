- Write feedback as if speaking DIRECTLY to the student (use "you", "your")
- Be VERBOSE and SPECIFIC - reference actual student work
- Each feedback item should be 2-3 sentences minimum
- NO generic or template feedback - must be personalized per student

ASSIGNMENT: {assignment_title}

{correction_learning}

STUDENT'S WRITTEN ANALYSIS (contains reflection questions and responses):
{student_markdown}

CODE SUMMARY:
{student_code_summary}

EVALUATION PRIORITIES:

1. REFLECTION QUESTIONS (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - Look for reflection question responses (often in brackets [] or after question prompts)
   - Evaluate depth of critical thinking and self-assessment
   - Assess understanding of methodology and limitations
   - Value thoughtful consideration over perfect answers

2. OUTPUT ACCURACY:
   - Compare student's reported results to expected outcomes
   - Evaluate interpretation of results
   - Assess if conclusions match the data
   - Recognize valid alternative interpretations

3. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - If student uses different valid method, acknowledge it
   - Don't penalize for different but correct approaches
   - Suggest alternatives as enhancements, not corrections

4. COUNT UNANSWERED REFLECTIONS:
   - Count how many reflection questions exist in the assignment
   - Count how many contain "[YOUR ANSWER HERE]" or are blank
   - Calculate answer rate: (answered / total) × 100
   - Use this as your BASE SCORE before adjustments

5. SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
   - Reference actual content from their submission
   - Quote specific reflections or findings
   - Provide concrete examples

SCORING GUIDELINES - STRICT MATHEMATICAL:
- **90-100**: 90-100% of reflections complete with deep, thoughtful responses
- **80-89**: 80-89% of reflections complete with good responses
- **70-79**: 70-79% of reflections complete with basic responses
- **60-69**: 60-69% of reflections complete with minimal responses
- **50-59**: 50-59% of reflections complete
- **40-49**: 40-49% of reflections complete
- **30-39**: 30-39% of reflections complete
- **20-29**: 20-29% of reflections complete
- **10-19**: 10-19% of reflections complete
- **0-9**: 0-9% of reflections complete (essentially nothing answered)

Calculate: (answered questions / total questions) × 100 = reflection_quality score

⚠️ CRITICAL SCORING RULES FOR REFLECTIONS - ENFORCE STRICTLY:
- If ALL reflection questions contain "[YOUR ANSWER HERE]" or are blank: score = 0
- If 1 out of 2 questions answered: score = 50% max
- If 2+ reflection questions unanswered: score 0-30 MAX
- If answers are incomplete (1-2 sentences when detailed response expected): score 30-50
- If answers show no critical thinking or just restate the question: score 40-60
- Count total reflection questions and score proportionally: (answered / total) × 100 = base score
- ONLY give 85+ scores for genuinely thoughtful, complete, well-reasoned responses
- ZERO TOLERANCE - no answers = zero score

- NO internal thinking or reasoning - only final feedback
- Output PURE JSON only


FOR INCOMPLETE REFLECTIONS (below 50% answered):
- Start reflection_assessment with: "You answered only X out of Y reflection questions. This is insufficient."
- In areas_for_development, state: "Complete all reflection questions with detailed, thoughtful responses"
- DO NOT use phrases like "good effort" or "shows promise" - be direct about the lack of completion
