    "**What we're doing:**\n",
    "1. Creating sample data as text (with headers and comma-separated values)\n",

    "3. Reading it back using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse\n",
    "\n",
    "**About CSV files:**\n",
    "- **CSV** = Comma-Separated Values\n",
    "- Very common format for data exchange\n",
    "- Can be opened in Excel, R, Python, databases, etc.\n",
    "- Simple text format that's human-readable\n",
    "\n",
    "**`read_csv()` vs base R's `read.csv()`:**\n",
    "- `read_csv()` (tidyverse) is faster and more reliable\n",
    "- Better at guessing data types\n",
    "- Creates tibbles (enhanced data frames)"
