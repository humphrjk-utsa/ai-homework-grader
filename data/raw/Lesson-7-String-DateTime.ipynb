    "# Lesson 7: String Manipulation and Date/Time Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Working with Text and Temporal Data in R\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Use `stringr` functions to clean and manipulate text data\n",
    "- Apply `lubridate` functions to parse and work with dates\n",
    "- Extract components from dates (year, month, day, weekday)\n",
    "- Perform date calculations for business analytics\n",
    "- Combine string and date operations for real-world data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time:** 60 minutes\n",

    "## Background: Why These Skills Matter in Business\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reality of Data in the Wild\n",
    "\n",
    "According to industry surveys and data science professionals:\n",
    "- **80% of analysis time** is spent on data cleaning and preparation\n",
    "- **Text data** contains valuable insights but arrives messy: inconsistent capitalization, extra spaces, typos, abbreviations\n",
    "- **Date/time data** comes in countless formats: \"2024-01-15\", \"01/15/2024\", \"Jan 15, 2024\", \"15-Jan-24\"\n",
    "- **Data integration** from multiple sources requires standardization before analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering string and date manipulation enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revenue Growth:**\n",
    "- Analyze customer feedback to identify product improvements\n",
    "- Segment customers by purchase recency for targeted marketing\n",
    "- Identify seasonal patterns to optimize inventory and pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Efficiency:**\n",
    "- Automate data cleaning processes (saving hours of manual work)\n",
    "- Standardize product names and categories across systems\n",
    "- Track response times and identify bottlenecks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Insights:**\n",
    "- Understand temporal patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal trends)\n",
    "- Identify at-risk customers based on engagement recency\n",
    "- Measure campaign effectiveness over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**E-commerce Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problem: Product names from suppliers are inconsistent\n",
    "- \"  laptop PRO 15-inch  \" vs \"Laptop Pro 15\\\"\" vs \"LAPTOP-PRO-15\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use stringr to standardize\n",
    "- Remove extra spaces: str_trim()\n",
    "- Standardize case: str_to_title()\n",
    "- Extract key info: str_extract() for screen size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Service Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problem: Need to identify customers who haven't purchased recently\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use lubridate to calculate recency\n",
    "- Parse dates: ymd()\n",
    "- Calculate days since: today() - last_purchase_date\n",
    "- Segment: case_when() based on recency\n",

    "## Part 2: String Manipulation with stringr\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why String Cleaning Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:** Inconsistent text data leads to:\n",
    "- Duplicate categories that should be the same (\"Peripherals\" vs \"PERIPHERALS\" vs \"peripherals\")\n",
    "- Failed joins between datasets (\"Laptop Pro\" doesn't match \"  laptop PRO  \")\n",
    "- Inaccurate counts and summaries\n",
    "- Poor user experience in reports and dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Standardize text data using stringr functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core stringr Functions Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning Functions:**\n",
    "- `str_trim(string)` - Removes whitespace from start and end\n",
    "  - Example: `str_trim(\"  hello  \")` \u2192 `\"hello\"`\n",
    "- `str_squish(string)` - Removes leading/trailing whitespace AND reduces internal whitespace to single spaces\n",
    "  - Example: `str_squish(\"  hello    world  \")` \u2192 `\"hello world\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Conversion:**\n",
    "- `str_to_lower(string)` - Convert to lowercase\n",
    "  - Example: `str_to_lower(\"HELLO World\")` \u2192 `\"hello world\"`\n",
    "- `str_to_upper(string)` - Convert to UPPERCASE\n",
    "  - Example: `str_to_upper(\"hello world\")` \u2192 `\"HELLO WORLD\"`\n",
    "- `str_to_title(string)` - Convert to Title Case\n",
    "  - Example: `str_to_title(\"hello world\")` \u2192 `\"Hello World\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Detection:**\n",
    "- `str_detect(string, pattern)` - Returns TRUE if pattern found, FALSE otherwise\n",
    "  - Example: `str_detect(\"wireless mouse\", \"wireless\")` \u2192 `TRUE`\n",
    "  - Use case: Filter products, flag records, create indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Extraction:**\n",
    "- `str_extract(string, pattern)` - Extracts first match of pattern\n",
    "  - Example: `str_extract(\"15-inch screen\", \"\\\\d+\")` \u2192 `\"15\"`\n",
    "  - Use case: Pull out numbers, codes, specific words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Replacement:**\n",
    "- `str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)` - Replace first match\n",
    "- `str_replace_all(string, pattern, replacement)` - Replace all matches\n",
    "  - Example: `str_replace_all(\"comp\", \"comp\", \"computer\")` \u2192 `\"computer\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expression Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\\\d` - Any digit (0-9)\n",
    "- `\\\\d+` - One or more digits\n",
    "- `\\\\w` - Any word character (letter, digit, underscore)\n",
    "- `\\\\s` - Any whitespace\n",
    "- `^` - Start of string\n",
    "- `$` - End of string\n",
    "- `|` - OR (e.g., \"pro|premium|deluxe\")\n",
    "- `.` - Any character\n",
    "- `*` - Zero or more\n",
    "- `+` - One or more\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In R, you need double backslashes `\\\\` because backslash is an escape character."

    "## Part 3: Date/Time Manipulation with lubridate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Date/Time Skills Are Critical for Business\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problems:**\n",
    "- Dates come in different formats from different systems\n",
    "- Need to calculate customer recency for segmentation\n",
    "- Must identify seasonal patterns and trends\n",
    "- Time-based analysis drives inventory, staffing, marketing decisions\n",
    "- Incorrect date handling leads to wrong business decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scenario: E-commerce company wants to re-engage inactive customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to answer:\n",
    "- Who hasn't purchased in 90+ days?\n",
    "- What day of week do customers shop most?\n",
    "- Are there seasonal patterns in purchases?\n",
    "- How long between repeat purchases?\n",
    "\n",
    "All require date manipulation!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core lubridate Functions Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parsing Functions (String \u2192 Date):**\n",
    "- `ymd(\"2024-01-15\")` - Parse Year-Month-Day format\n",
    "- `mdy(\"01/15/2024\")` - Parse Month-Day-Year format (common in US)\n",
    "- `dmy(\"15-01-2024\")` - Parse Day-Month-Year format (common in Europe)\n",
    "- `ymd_hms(\"2024-01-15 14:30:00\")` - Parse date with time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Different systems use different formats. lubridate handles them all!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Functions (Date \u2192 Components):**\n",
    "- `year(date)` - Extract year as number (2024)\n",
    "- `month(date)` - Extract month as number (1-12)\n",
    "- `month(date, label=TRUE)` - Extract month name (\"January\")\n",
    "- `day(date)` - Extract day of month (1-31)\n",
    "- `wday(date)` - Extract day of week as number (1=Sunday, 7=Saturday)\n",
    "- `wday(date, label=TRUE)` - Extract weekday name (\"Monday\")\n",
    "- `quarter(date)` - Extract quarter (1-4)\n",
    "- `week(date)` - Extract week of year (1-53)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Date/Time:**\n",
    "- `today()` - Current date (no time)\n",
    "- `now()` - Current date and time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date Arithmetic:**\n",
    "- `today() - date` - Days between dates\n",
    "- `date + days(7)` - Add 7 days\n",
    "- `date + months(1)` - Add 1 month\n",
    "- `floor_date(date, \"month\")` - Round down to start of month\n",
    "- `ceiling_date(date, \"month\")` - Round up to start of next month\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Segmentation:**\n",
    "- Calculate days since last purchase\n",
    "- Segment: New (< 30 days), Active (< 90 days), At-Risk (90-180 days), Churned (> 180 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend Analysis:**\n",
    "- Group sales by month, quarter, or year\n",
    "- Identify seasonal patterns\n",
    "- Calculate year-over-year growth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Planning:**\n",
    "- Identify peak days/hours for staffing\n",
    "- Analyze weekend vs weekday patterns\n",
    "- Track response times and SLAs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marketing Timing:**\n",
    "- Determine best days to send campaigns\n",
    "- Identify seasonal promotion opportunities\n",
    "- Calculate optimal re-engagement timing"
