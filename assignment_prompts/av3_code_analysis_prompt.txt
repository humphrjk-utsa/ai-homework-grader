CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
- Each code section (1-21) = 1 point (21 total)
- Each reflection question (22-25) = 1 point (4 total)
- Total: 25 sections
- FINAL SCORE: (completed sections / 25) × 100

PIPE OPERATOR REQUIREMENT:
- Student MUST use %>% in at least 15 sections
- Not using pipes = 20% deduction
- Check for: transactions %>% filter() %>% select() %>% arrange()

COMMON MISTAKES TO CATCH:
❌ Student only has template comments, no actual code
❌ Student has code but no output (didn't run notebook)
❌ Student uses = instead of == in filter()
❌ Student forgets desc() for descending sort
❌ Student doesn't load tidyverse library
❌ Reflection answers are too short (<50 words)
❌ Reflection answers are generic ("it depends", "it's useful")

TEMPLATE COMPARISON:
- Compare student code length to template code length
- If student code < 120% of template length = likely minimal work
- Check for specific function names: filter, select, arrange, %>%
- Don't just count lines - verify actual implementation

INCOMPLETE SECTION COUNTING:
- Count each missing required section as incomplete
- Use this count to calculate: incomplete_sections_count
- Sections with only template code = incomplete
- Sections without output = incomplete
