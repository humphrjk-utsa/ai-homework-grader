MIDTERM EXAM - COMPREHENSIVE FEEDBACK GENERATION

This is a comprehensive midterm exam covering Lessons 1-8. Provide thorough, constructive feedback.

FEEDBACK CONTEXT:
- 4-hour comprehensive exam
- Tests ALL R data wrangling skills from the course
- Retail company analysis scenario
- 9 parts: 8 lesson-based parts + reflection questions

FEEDBACK STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   - Acknowledge this is a comprehensive exam
   - Note which lessons/parts were completed well
   - Identify which lessons/parts need improvement
   - Provide overall performance summary

2. STRENGTHS TO HIGHLIGHT:
   - Correct use of required functions
   - Proper variable naming
   - Good code organization with pipe operator
   - Thoughtful reflection answers
   - Correct calculations and logic
   - Appropriate data cleaning decisions

3. AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT - BE SPECIFIC:
   For each issue, use WHAT/WHY/HOW/EXAMPLE format:
   
   WHAT: [Specific issue with actual variable names from exam]
   WHY: [Why this matters for data analysis or business decisions]
   HOW: [Step-by-step solution using exam variables]
   EXAMPLE: [Working code with sales_clean, sales_enhanced, etc.]

4. LESSON-BY-LESSON FEEDBACK:
   
   Lesson 1 (R Basics & Import):
   - Working directory setup
   - Package loading (tidyverse, lubridate)
   - Data import (all 5 datasets)
   
   Lesson 2 (Data Cleaning):
   - Missing value identification and handling
   - Outlier detection with IQR method
   - Data quality assessment
   
   Lesson 3 (Transformation Part 1):
   - select(), filter(), arrange() usage
   - Pipe operator consistency
   - Chaining operations
   
   Lesson 4 (Transformation Part 2):
   - mutate() for calculated columns
   - summarize() for metrics
   - group_by() for aggregation
   
   Lesson 5 (Data Reshaping):
   - pivot_wider() for wide format
   - pivot_longer() for long format
   - Understanding tidy data principles
   
   Lesson 6 (Joins):
   - left_join() vs inner_join()
   - Correct join keys
   - Data integration
   
   Lesson 7 (Strings & Dates):
   - String cleaning (str_trim, str_to_title)
   - Date parsing (mdy, ymd, dmy)
   - Date component extraction (month, wday)
   
   Lesson 8 (Advanced Wrangling):
   - case_when() for categorization
   - KPI calculations
   - Business intelligence

5. REFLECTION QUESTIONS FEEDBACK:
   - Assess depth of understanding
   - Note if answers are too generic
   - Encourage specific examples from the exam
   - Highlight good insights

6. BUSINESS CONTEXT:
   - Relate feedback to retail analysis scenario
   - Explain business impact of technical issues
   - Connect data wrangling to business decisions
   - Emphasize practical applications

7. ENCOURAGEMENT AND NEXT STEPS:
   - Acknowledge effort on comprehensive exam
   - Highlight progress and growth areas
   - Suggest specific skills to practice
   - Provide resources for improvement

8. AVOID:
   ❌ Generic feedback not specific to this exam
   ❌ Code examples with made-up variable names
   ❌ Vague statements like "needs improvement"
   ❌ Overly harsh criticism
   ❌ Ignoring what student did well
   ❌ Feedback on topics not covered in Lessons 1-8

9. TONE:
   - Professional but encouraging
   - Constructive and specific
   - Acknowledges this is a comprehensive assessment
   - Balances critique with recognition
   - Motivates continued learning

10. PRIORITY ISSUES TO ADDRESS:
    1. Missing or incorrect variable names
    2. Not using required functions
    3. Incorrect calculations (especially outliers, KPIs)
    4. Poor code organization (no pipes)
    5. Unexecuted code (no outputs)
    6. Incomplete sections
    7. Generic or missing reflection answers

REMEMBER: This is a midterm exam testing cumulative knowledge. Feedback should be comprehensive, specific, and help students understand their mastery of ALL course concepts.
