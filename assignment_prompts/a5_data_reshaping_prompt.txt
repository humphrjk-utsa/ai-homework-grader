ASSIGNMENT 5 - DATA RESHAPING WITH TIDYR - SPECIFIC GRADING INSTRUCTIONS

=== ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW ===
This assignment focuses on data reshaping using pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() functions from the tidyr package.
Students work with three datasets: quarterly sales (wide), survey responses (long), and employee skills (wide).

=== KEY LEARNING OBJECTIVES ===
1. Master pivot_longer() for wide-to-long transformations
2. Master pivot_wider() for long-to-wide transformations  
3. Understand when to use each format for different analyses
4. Implement proper data validation after transformations
5. Apply reshaping to real business scenarios

=== CRITICAL GRADING POINTS ===

1. REQUIRED VARIABLES (Must be created):
   - quarterly_sales_wide (imported)
   - survey_responses_long (imported)
   - employee_skills_wide (imported)
   - quarterly_sales_long (Task 2.1)
   - quarterly_sales_parsed (Task 2.2)
   - employee_skills_long (Task 2.3)
   - survey_responses_wide (Task 3.1)
   - sales_by_region_wide (Task 3.2)
   - skills_matrix (Task 3.3)

2. CORE RESHAPING TASKS (40% of grade):
   Part 2: Wide to Long (12 points)
   - Task 2.1: Basic pivot_longer with starts_with()
   - Task 2.2: Name parsing with names_sep
   - Task 2.3: Employee skills transformation
   
   Part 3: Long to Wide (12 points)
   - Task 3.1: Survey responses with names_from/values_from
   - Task 3.2: Regional sales comparison matrix
   - Task 3.3: Skills matrix creation

3. DATA VALIDATION (15% of grade):
   Students must validate:
   - Data totals preserved after transformation
   - Record counts match expectations
   - No unexpected missing values
   - Data types remain correct
   - Business logic consistency

4. REFLECTION QUESTIONS (20% of grade):
   Five questions requiring 150-200 words each.
   
   IMPORTANT: Grade based on THEMES and UNDERSTANDING, not specific answers.
   Accept any reasonable response that demonstrates:
   - Understanding of when/why to use different formats
   - Recognition of business impact and stakeholder needs
   - Critical thinking about data structure decisions
   - Ability to apply concepts to new situations
   
   Question Themes:
   - Question 1: Understanding format selection for business scenarios
   - Question 2: Recognizing importance of data validation
   - Question 3: Reflecting on learning and efficiency improvements
   - Question 4: Adapting communication for different audiences
   - Question 5: Transferring knowledge to future applications

=== COMMON STUDENT ERRORS TO CHECK ===

1. FILE PATH ISSUES:
   - Students may use incorrect paths to data files
   - Check if data imports successfully
   - Deduct heavily if data cannot be loaded

2. HARDCODED COLUMN NAMES:
   - Students may hardcode specific column names that don't exist
   - Example: Score_Service_Quality instead of using dynamic selection
   - This causes errors - check for c_across() or dynamic methods

3. MISSING VALIDATION:
   - Many students skip validation checks
   - Look for: sum comparisons, nrow checks, identical() tests
   - No validation = 0 points for validation component

4. INCOMPLETE REFLECTION:
   - Students may leave template text "[Write your response here]"
   - Check word counts (minimum 150-200 words per question)
   - Generic answers without specific examples = low scores

5. SYNTAX ERRORS:
   - Common: Missing commas in pivot_longer/wider
   - Common: Incorrect use of names_to vs names_from
   - Common: Forgetting to assign results to variables
   - Code that doesn't run = 0 points for that section

=== SPECIFIC FUNCTION USAGE TO VERIFY ===

pivot_longer() must include:
- cols parameter (what to reshape)
- names_to parameter (new column name)
- values_to parameter (values column name)
- Optional: names_sep, names_pattern for parsing

pivot_wider() must include:
- names_from parameter (column to spread)
- values_from parameter (values to fill)
- Optional: names_prefix, values_fill

=== VALIDATION CHECKS TO LOOK FOR ===

Students should demonstrate:
1. Comparing totals before/after transformation
2. Checking record counts (nrow before vs after)
3. Verifying no unexpected NAs
4. Confirming data types preserved
5. Testing business logic (e.g., growth trends positive)

Example validation code to look for:
- sum(original_data) == sum(transformed_data)
- nrow(wide) * n_columns == nrow(long)
- identical(distribution_before, distribution_after)

=== BUSINESS CONTEXT EVALUATION ===

Look for UNDERSTANDING OF CONCEPTS, not specific examples.

Students should demonstrate understanding of:

1. FORMAT SELECTION REASONING (accept any valid reasoning):
   - Why certain formats work better for certain tasks
   - How format affects analysis workflow
   - Trade-offs between formats
   - Stakeholder needs and preferences
   
   Examples of valid reasoning (not exhaustive):
   - Long format for: time series, grouping, statistical models, visualizations
   - Wide format for: comparisons, reports, correlations, human readability

2. BUSINESS IMPACT AWARENESS (accept any reasonable impact):
   - Efficiency and time savings
   - Better decision-making
   - Improved communication
   - Reduced errors
   - Stakeholder satisfaction
   
3. CRITICAL THINKING (key indicator):
   - Can explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - Connects technical choices to business outcomes
   - Considers multiple perspectives
   - Shows learning and growth

=== GRADING WORKFLOW ===

Step 1: Check Technical Execution (25 points)
- Does code run without errors?
- Are all required variables created?
- Is pipe operator used properly?
- Are outputs visible?

Step 2: Evaluate Data Reshaping (40 points)
- Part 2 tasks (12 points): Check each pivot_longer task
- Part 3 tasks (12 points): Check each pivot_wider task
- Parts 4-6 (16 points): Complex scenarios, business analysis, validation

Step 3: Assess Validation (15 points)
- Are validation checks present?
- Do they actually verify data integrity?
- Are results documented?

Step 4: Review Reflections (20 points)
- Are all 5 questions answered?
- Do answers meet word count minimums?
- Are examples specific and relevant?
- Is critical thinking demonstrated?

=== RED FLAGS (Automatic Low Scores) ===

- Template code unchanged = 0 points
- No outputs visible = 0 points for that section
- Data files not loaded = Cannot grade, major deduction
- Reflection questions blank = 0 points for reflection
- Code with syntax errors = 0 points for that section
- Missing required variables = 10% deduction each

=== EXCELLENCE INDICATORS (High Scores) ===

Technical:
- All code runs perfectly with outputs
- All 9 required variables created correctly
- Comprehensive validation throughout
- Clean, well-commented code
- Proper use of tidyverse style

Reflection (focus on DEPTH, not specific content):
- Demonstrates clear understanding of concepts
- Provides specific examples (any reasonable examples)
- Shows critical thinking and reasoning
- Connects technical skills to business value
- Reflects on personal learning journey
- Meets or exceeds word count requirements

=== PARTIAL CREDIT GUIDELINES ===

- Code present but no output = 50% of section points
- Validation attempted but incomplete = 50-75% of validation points
- Reflection answers under word count = 50% of question points
- Correct approach but minor errors = 75-90% of section points

=== GRADING REFLECTION QUESTIONS - IMPORTANT ===

DO NOT grade based on matching specific examples or scenarios.
DO grade based on:

1. UNDERSTANDING OF CONCEPTS:
   - Does the student understand when/why to use different formats?
   - Can they explain the reasoning behind format choices?
   - Do they recognize business implications?

2. DEPTH OF THINKING:
   - Are answers thoughtful and detailed?
   - Do they provide specific examples (any reasonable examples)?
   - Do they show critical thinking?

3. LEARNING DEMONSTRATED:
   - Does the student show growth in understanding?
   - Can they apply concepts to new situations?
   - Do they connect technical skills to business value?

4. COMMUNICATION:
   - Are answers clear and well-organized?
   - Do they meet word count requirements?
   - Are examples relevant to the question?

ACCEPT DIVERSE ANSWERS:
- Different business scenarios are equally valid
- Different stakeholder examples are fine
- Different efficiency estimates are acceptable
- Different future applications are valid
- Focus on the QUALITY OF REASONING, not the specific content

=== FINAL NOTES ===

This assignment tests both technical skills (reshaping) and strategic thinking (when/why to reshape).
Weight the technical execution heavily but don't ignore the reflection component.
Students who demonstrate understanding of business applications deserve higher scores.
Look for evidence of learning and growth, not just correct answers.
Grade reflection questions based on understanding and reasoning, not matching specific examples.
