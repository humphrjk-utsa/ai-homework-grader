ASSIGNMENT-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT 2V1 FEEDBACK:

REFLECTION QUESTIONS EVALUATION:

Question 1: "When would you prefer removing rows with missing values vs imputation?"
✓ EXCELLENT (90-100%): Discusses dataset size, missing data percentage, data type, analysis goals
✓ GOOD (75-89%): Mentions 2-3 factors with some reasoning
✓ ADEQUATE (60-74%): Mentions 1-2 factors but limited reasoning
✓ POOR (40-59%): Generic answer like "it depends" without specifics
✓ FAIL (0-39%): No answer or completely off-topic

Question 2: "What do outliers represent in business data? Should they always be removed?"
✓ EXCELLENT (90-100%): Discusses legitimate vs errors, business context, investigation needed
✓ GOOD (75-89%): Mentions multiple perspectives with reasoning
✓ ADEQUATE (60-74%): Basic understanding but limited depth
✓ POOR (40-59%): Oversimplified (e.g., "always remove" or "never remove")
✓ FAIL (0-39%): No answer or completely off-topic

METHODOLOGY EVALUATION:

Missing Value Treatment:
- Option A (removal) = valid if dataset is large enough
- Option B (imputation) = valid if justified with appropriate method
- BOTH options = extra credit for thoroughness
- NEITHER option = major deduction

Outlier Treatment:
- Option A (removal) = valid if outliers are errors
- Option B (capping) = valid if outliers are legitimate extreme values
- BOTH options = extra credit for thoroughness
- NEITHER option = major deduction

CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
✓ All code cells executed with visible output = full credit
✓ Code present but not executed = 50% deduction
✓ Only template code, no student additions = 80% deduction
✓ Incorrect variable names or broken code = deduction per error

REFLECTION QUALITY SCORING:
- Both questions answered excellently = 90-100%
- Both questions answered well = 75-89%
- Both questions answered adequately = 60-74%
- One question missing or poor = 40-59%
- Both questions missing or poor = 0-39%

FEEDBACK STRUCTURE:

reflection_assessment:
- Evaluate depth of understanding shown in reflection answers
- Comment on whether student demonstrates critical thinking
- Note if answers are generic vs specific to their analysis

analytical_strengths:
- Highlight correct implementations of missing value/outlier detection
- Praise appropriate choice of treatment method
- Note good data quality assessment practices

business_application:
- Comment on understanding of real-world implications
- Evaluate discussion of when to use different approaches
- Assess awareness of business context in data cleaning decisions

learning_demonstration:
- Note mastery of R functions (is.na, complete.cases, IQR, etc.)
- Comment on proper use of tidyverse for data manipulation
- Evaluate understanding of statistical concepts (quartiles, outliers)

areas_for_development:
- Point out missing required sections
- Identify incomplete implementations
- Note where reflection answers lack depth
- Highlight where code wasn't executed

recommendations:
- Suggest specific improvements for incomplete sections
