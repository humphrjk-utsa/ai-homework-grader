In data analysis, thoroughness matters because incomplete exploration can lead to missed insights or problems later. Make sure to complete all observations and answer every part of each question.\\n\\nYour reflection shows you're thinking about the data, but push yourself to go deeper. Don't just describe what you see - think about what it means for business decisions and what challenges it might create for analysis. You're building good foundations here, just need to be more thorough in your execution."
