            "You correctly identified that the sales dataset would be most ready for analysis - this shows good business intuition about working with structured numerical data.",

    "instructor_comments": "This is a solid start to the assignment that shows you understand the fundamentals of data exploration and business analytics. You've set up your environment correctly and are asking the right questions about data readiness and quality. Your reflection shows you're thinking critically about the data, which is exactly what we want to see in this course.\n\nThe main areas to focus on are completeness and attention to detail. Make sure you're answering each question fully and distinctly - I noticed Question 2 seemed to repeat the answer from Question 1. Also, don't forget to include your actual code outputs and complete all sections, including the sales_df observations.\n\nYour understanding of data types and business context is strong, and you're developing good analytical instincts about which datasets need more work. Keep building on this foundation by being more thorough in your documentation and more specific in your observations. You're on the right track - just need to push a bit deeper into the details."
